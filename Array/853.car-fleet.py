# Testcase Example:  '12\n[10,8,0,5,3]\n[2,4,1,1,3]'
#
# There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The
# destination is target miles away.
# 
# You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where
# position[i] is the position of the i^th car and speed[i] is the speed of the
# i^th car (in miles per hour).
# 
# A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to itÂ and
# drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to
# match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored
# (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).
# 
# A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and
# same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.
# 
# If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will
# still be considered as one car fleet.
# 
# Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting
# each other at 12.
# The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by
# itself.
# The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each
# other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
# Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the
# answer is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each
# other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
# Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one
# fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches
# target.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == position.length == speed.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 < target <= 10^6
# 0 <= position[i] < target
# All the values of position are unique.
# 0 < speed[i] <= 10^6
# 
#

class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        # [(10, 2), (8, 4), (0, 1), (5, 1), (3, 3)]
        pairs = list(zip(position,speed))
        # sort according to position
        pairs.sort(key = lambda i : i[0])

        stack = []
        # start with the car nearest to the destination, so we traverse in reverse order
        for p,s in pairs[::-1]:

            # get the time needed for the car to reach the dest
            # eg. car1      car2       dest
            # if car needs 2secs and car2 needs 4secs, they will collide and form 1 single car fleet
            time_needed = (target - p) / s
            stack.append(time_needed)

            # need at least 2 cars in stack for comparison
            # compare time_taken for 2 cards to reach the destination
            if len(stack) >= 2 and stack[-1] <= stack[-2]:
                stack.pop()

        return len(stack)

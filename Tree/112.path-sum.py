#
# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the
# tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the
# path equals targetSum.
# 
# A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
# Output: false
# Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
# (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
# (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
# There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, curSum):
            if not node:
                return 
            
            curSum += node.val 

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                if curSum == targetSum:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
           
            res = dfs(node.left, curSum) or dfs(node.right, curSum)
            
            curSum -= node.val

            return res
        
        return dfs(root, 0)

#
# Given the head of a linked list, remove the n^th node from the end of the
# list and return its head.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # move r to a positoin where l - r = n + 1
        dummyNode = ListNode(0,head)
        l = dummyNode
        r = head
        
        while r and n != 0:
            r = r.next
            n -= 1
            
        while l and r:
            l = l.next
            r = r.next
        # now l is at the postion just before the target node
        l.next = l.next.next
        
        return dummyNode.next

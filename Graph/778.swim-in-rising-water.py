# Testcase Example:  '[[0,2],[1,3]]'
#
# You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j]
# represents the elevation at that point (i, j).
# 
# The rain starts to fall. At time t, the depth of the water everywhere is t.
# You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and
# only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can
# swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the
# boundaries of the grid during your swim.
# 
# Return the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n -
# 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
# You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a
# higher elevation than t = 0.
# You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
# When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: grid =
# [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
# Output: 16
# Explanation: The final route is shown.
# We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= n <= 50
# 0 <= grid[i][j] <Â n^2
# Each value grid[i][j] is unique.

                r = row + dr
                c = col + dc

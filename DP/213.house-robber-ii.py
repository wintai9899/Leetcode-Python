#
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
# house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
# arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last
# one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, andÂ it will
# automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on
# the same night.
# 
# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
# return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the
# police.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,3,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money =
# 2), because they are adjacent houses.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
# Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
#

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # rob the street skipping the first house 
        # rob the street skipping the last house in reverse order

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]

        return max(self.robHouse(nums[1:]), self.robHouse(nums[:-1]))
        
    def robHouse(self,nums):
        rob1, rob2 = 0,0

        for num in nums:
            nextRob = max(rob1 + num, rob2)
            rob1 = rob2
            rob2 = nextRob 
        
        return rob2

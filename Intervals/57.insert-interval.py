# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[6,9]]\n[2,5]'
#
# You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where
# intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the i^th
# interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also
# given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and
# end of another interval.
# 
# Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in
# ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping
# intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
# 
# Return intervals after the insertion.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
# Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
# Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
# Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with
# [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5
# intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
# newInterval.length == 2
# 0 <= start <= end <= 10^5

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            # if new interval is smaller than all other itnervals
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                # add new interval to the beginning and return 
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            # not overlapped
            # new start > cur end
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                res.append(intervals[i])
                
            else:
                # overlapped
                newStart = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0])
                newEnd = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])
                newInterval = [newStart, newEnd]
        res.append(newInterval)
        
        return res
